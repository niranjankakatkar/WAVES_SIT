    We have a <strong>30-day return policy</strong>, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Eligibility for Returns</h3>
  <p>
    To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unused, and in its original packaging. 
  </p>

    To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@tbhpackaging.co.uk" style="color: #0073e6; text-decoration: underline;">sales@tbhpackaging.co.uk</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and where to send your package. 
    <strong>Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Exchanges</h3>
  <p>
    The fastest way to ensure you get the product you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, 
    make a separate purchase for the new item.

    We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. 
    If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within <strong>5 working days</strong>. 
    Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and issue the refund to you.
  </p>
