          We have a <strong>30-day return policy</strong>, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to

        <h3 class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Eligibility for Returns
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-6">
          To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unused, and in its
          original packaging.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-6">
          To start a return, you can contact us at
         <strong> <a href="mailto:sales@wavespackaging.co.uk" style="text-decoration: underline">sales@wavespackaging.co.uk</a></strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-6">
          If your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and where to send your package.
          <strong>Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.</strong>

        <p class="fs-6">
          You can always contact us for any return questions at

        <h3 class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Damages and Issues</h3>
        <p class="fs-6">
          Please inspect your order upon delivery and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged, or if
          you receive the wrong item,
          so that we can rectify the issue accordingly.

        <h3 class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Exchanges</h3>
        <p class="fs-6">
          The fastest way to ensure you get the product you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is
          accepted,
          make a separate purchase for the new item.
        </p>

        <h3 class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Refunds</h3>
        <p class="fs-6">
          We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved
          or not.
          If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within <strong>5 working
            days</strong>.
          Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and issue the refund to
          you.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-6">
          If more than <strong>15 business days</strong> have passed since we’ve approved your return, please contact us
